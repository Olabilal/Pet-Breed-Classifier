# Pet-Breed-Classifier
Final project for the Building AI course

Summary

Develop an AI model to classify pet images as either dogs or cats. This tool will help shelters and pet owners quickly categorize pets to aid in adoption and lost pet identification.

Background

	•	Problem Statement: Identifying pets in images is crucial for shelters and owners but can be time-consuming.
	•	Frequency: This issue is prevalent in animal shelters and pet-related apps.
	•	Personal Motivation: Passion for animal welfare and desire to streamline pet adoption processes.
	•	Importance: Enhancing the efficiency of pet identification can improve adoption rates and help lost pets find their way home.

How is it used?

	•	Usage Scenarios: Used by animal shelters, pet adoption apps, and lost pet services.
	•	Users: Shelters, pet owners, and adoption agencies who need to categorize pets from images.

Data sources and AI methods

	•	Data Sources: Public datasets of pet images, such as the Kaggle Pets Dataset.
	•	AI Techniques: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.

Challenges

	•	Limitations: The model may struggle with images that are blurry or contain multiple pets.
	•	Ethical Considerations: Ensuring the model does not perpetuate biases in pet breed classification.

What next?

	•	Growth Potential: Integrate with a mobile app for real-time pet identification and add support for more breeds.
	•	Skills Needed: Experience in deep learning, mobile app development, and image processing.

Acknowledgment

	•	Sources of Inspiration: The work of other AI researchers in image classification.
	•	Licensing: Dataset provided under a Creative Commons license.
